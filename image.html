      <p><b>What Terastal Pokemon can do?</b></p>
      <p>Terastallizing a Pokémon allows you to enhance your battle strategies by increasing the power of any moves that have the same type as your Pokémon's Tera Type or by changing your Pokémon's weaknesses</p>

      <p><b>About new 3 pokemon I choose</b></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Paldean Wooper</li>
      <li>Smoliv</li>
      <li>Cetitan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Paldean Wooper is Poison/Ground type.<br>
        <b><big>They Live on the Land and Cover Their Bodies with a Poisonous Film</big></b><br>
        In ancient times, Wooper lived underwater in the Paldea region.But it seems after losing in a struggle for territory, they began living in bogs on land.
        To keep from drying out while living on land, they began to cover their bodies with a poisonous film.</p>

      <p>Smoliv is Grass/Normal type.<br>
          <b><big>Oil So Bitter and Astringent It Will Make You Flinch</big></b><br>
          The oil that comes out of its head has a very strong bitter taste, and it is not suitable for consumption. When startled or attacked, Smoliv will shoot this oil out, slowing its opponent down. It will then seize that moment to run away.</p>

      <p>Cetitan is Ice type.<br>
        <b><big>Strong Muscles and Thick Blubber</big></b><br>
        Cetitan need to have tough muscles to be able to support their immense bodies, and physical attacks using their bodies have incredible power. They also migrate around the snowy regions, protected by a thick layer of subcutaneous fat.</p>
